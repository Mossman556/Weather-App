# Weather-App

This Weather App is a simple and user-friendly application that allows users to search for current weather information by entering a location (city). 
The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the information in a clean and organized manner.

# Features

* Search for weather information by city name
* Displays an error message for invalid city input
* Shows the current weather condition with a relevant image
* Displays the current temperature (in Celsius)
* Provides a description of the current weather
* Shows additional weather details such as humidity and wind speed
* Utilizes responsive design to work well on various screen sizes
* Uses Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons for an enhanced UI experience

# Usage

To run the Weather App, simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser. 
Enter the desired city name in the search box and click the search button to fetch and display the weather data.

Please note that you need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap or another weather API and replace the placeholder 'YOUR API KEY' in the index.js file with your actual API key for the application to function properly.

# Files

The Weather App consists of three main files:

* index.html: Contains the structure and layout of the application, including the search box, weather display, and additional weather details.
* index.js: Handles the search functionality, fetches weather data from the API, processes the response, and updates the DOM to display the weather information.
* style.css: Styles the application and provides a clean and organized appearance.
